# sample_scurvegen
Verilog S-curve generator for stepper control

This is a snippet of a larger FPGA design and C++ program to drive it. These parts are concerned with
the stepper step/dir generation logic and the code to calculate the timing of the move.

This is only "fyi" reference code, provided as an example. It's not intended to be a complete solution
and it's heavily geared to my specific OpenPnP build. Your mileage will definitely vary.
